Overview
The Pizzaz demo app bundles a handful of UI components so you can see the full tool surface area end-to-end. The following sections walk through the MCP server and the component implementations that power those tools. You can find the “Pizzaz” demo app and other examples in our examples repository on GitHub.

Use these examples as blueprints when you assemble your own app.
