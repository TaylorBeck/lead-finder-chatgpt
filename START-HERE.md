## 🎬 What To Do Right Now

### Step 1: Understand What You Have

Your app has **two separate services**:

1. **MCP Server** (Python FastAPI)
   - Handles tool calls from ChatGPT
   - Generates mock lead data
   - Returns structured data + widget HTML
   - Lives in: `lead-finder-server/`

2. **UI Service** (React Components)
   - Interactive widgets shown in ChatGPT
   - Three components: lead-finder, dashboard, export
   - Lives in: `lead-finder-ui/`

### Step 2: Choose Your Deployment Path

**Recommended: Railway (One Platform)**
- Free tier available
- Automatic HTTPS
- Simple environment variables
- Git-based deployment

**Alternative: Vercel + Render (Two Platforms)**
- UI on Vercel (fast edge network)
- Server on Render (free tier)
- Slightly more setup

### Step 3: Open the Right Guide

👉 **Start with**: [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)

It will walk you through:
- Creating Railway account
- Deploying both services
- Setting environment variables
- Connecting to ChatGPT
- Testing everything

### Step 4: Track Your Progress

👉 **Use**: [DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md](./DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md)

Check off each step as you complete it.

### Step 5: Quick Reference

👉 **Keep open**: [RAILWAY-QUICKSTART.md](./RAILWAY-QUICKSTART.md)

Refer to this for commands and URLs while deploying.

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

- **Reading DEPLOYMENT.md**: 10 minutes
- **Deploying UI Service**: 2 minutes
- **Deploying MCP Server**: 2 minutes
- **Connecting to ChatGPT**: 1 minute
- **Testing**: 5 minutes

**Total**: ~20 minutes (first time)

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Widget doesn't appear | Check `WIDGET_BASE_URL` environment variable |
| CORS errors | Ensure UI start command has `--cors` flag |
| MCP won't connect | Add `/mcp` to the end of your URL |
| Railway build fails | Check deployment logs in Railway dashboard |

### Where to Look for Help

1. **Full troubleshooting**: [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) → "Troubleshooting" section
2. **Railway logs**: Railway Dashboard → Service → Deployments → View Logs
3. **Browser console**: Press F12 to see JavaScript errors
4. **Architecture guide**: [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for understanding

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- [ ] GitHub account (to host your code)
- [ ] Railway account (sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app))
- [ ] ChatGPT Plus or Pro (for Developer Mode)
- [ ] Code working locally (optional but recommended)
- [ ] 20 minutes of time

## 🎓 Understanding the Big Picture

### The MCP Protocol

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is how ChatGPT talks to external tools:

1. **You define tools** (find leads, export to CRM, etc.)
2. **ChatGPT calls them** (when user asks relevant questions)
3. **Your server responds** (with data + optional widget HTML)
4. **ChatGPT renders widgets** (interactive React components)

### The OpenAI Apps SDK

The Apps SDK lets you create **interactive widgets** in ChatGPT:

- Widgets run in sandboxed iframes
- They can call back to your tools via `window.openai.callTool()`
- They adapt to theme (light/dark) and display mode (inline/fullscreen)
- They persist state across conversations

### Your Lead Finder App

Combines both concepts:

```
User: "Find leads for CRM software"
  ↓
ChatGPT: Calls find-business-leads tool
  ↓
Your MCP Server: Returns lead data + widget HTML
  ↓
ChatGPT: Renders widget with lead list
  ↓
User: Clicks "Enrich Selected" in widget
  ↓
Widget: Calls enrich-prospect-data tool
  ↓
Process repeats...
```
